To translate the given SQL query into C#, we need to understand that the SQL query is essentially a no-op because it selects all records from table `x` where the condition `1 = 2` is always false. Therefore, the query will always return an empty result set. In C#, we can simulate this logic by creating a method that returns an empty collection. Here's how you can implement this in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Call the method to get results
        var results = GetRecordsFromX();

        // Display the results
        Console.WriteLine("Results count: " + results.Count);
    }

    // Method to simulate the SQL query
    static List<object> GetRecordsFromX()
    {
        // Simulate the SQL query: SELECT * FROM x WHERE 1 = 2
        // This will always return an empty list because the condition is always false
        return new List<object>();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **GetRecordsFromX Method**: This method simulates the SQL query by returning an empty list, as the condition `1 = 2` is always false.
- **Main Method**: Calls `GetRecordsFromX` and prints the count of results, which will always be zero.
