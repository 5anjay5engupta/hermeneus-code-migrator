Translating the given C# code to SQL involves creating a stored procedure that generates and prints Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit. SQL is not inherently designed for iterative processes like generating Fibonacci numbers, but we can achieve this using a loop within a stored procedure.

Here's the SQL translation:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GenerateFibonacciSeries
AS
BEGIN
    -- Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    DECLARE @first INT = 0;
    DECLARE @second INT = 1;
    DECLARE @next INT;

    -- Print the first Fibonacci number
    PRINT @first;

    -- Generate and print Fibonacci numbers until the value exceeds 100
    WHILE @second <= 100
    BEGIN
        PRINT @second;

        -- Calculate the next Fibonacci number
        SET @next = @first + @second;

        -- Update the previous two numbers
        SET @first = @second;
        SET @second = @next;
    END
END;
```

### Explanation:
- **Stored Procedure**: The logic is encapsulated in a stored procedure named `GenerateFibonacciSeries`.
- **Variables**: We use `DECLARE` to initialize and manage variables `@first`, `@second`, and `@next`.
- **PRINT**: The `PRINT` statement is used to output the Fibonacci numbers, similar to `Console.WriteLine` in C#.
- **WHILE Loop**: The `WHILE` loop continues to execute as long as `@second` is less than or equal to 100, similar to the C# `while` loop.
