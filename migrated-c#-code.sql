To translate the given C# code into T-SQL, we need to create a stored procedure that simulates the behavior of the C# program. The original C# code simulates a SQL query that returns no results by using a method that returns an empty collection. In T-SQL, we can achieve this by creating a stored procedure that executes a query with a condition that is always false, such as `1 = 2`.

Here is the equivalent T-SQL code:

```sql
-- Create a stored procedure to simulate the SQL query: SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE 1 = 2
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmptyResults
AS
BEGIN
    -- This query will always return no results because the condition is always false
    SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE 1 = 2;
END
GO

-- Execute the stored procedure to demonstrate its behavior
EXEC GetEmptyResults;
```

### Explanation:
- **Stored Procedure `GetEmptyResults`**: This stored procedure contains a `SELECT` statement with a condition `1 = 2`, which is always false, ensuring that no rows are returned.
- **Execution of the Stored Procedure**: The `EXEC GetEmptyResults;` statement demonstrates how to call the stored procedure, which will result in no output since the query returns no results.
