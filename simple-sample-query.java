To translate the given SQL query into Java, we need to understand that the SQL query is designed to return no results because the condition `1 = 2` is always false. In Java, we can simulate this by creating a method that returns an empty list or collection, as there are no rows to fetch.

Here's how you can translate the SQL query into Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DatabaseQuery {

    // Simulating a database table row as a class
    static class TableRow {
        // Add fields that represent columns in the table
        // For example:
        // private int id;
        // private String name;
        
        // Constructor, getters, and setters can be added here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<TableRow> results = selectFromTableWhereConditionIsFalse();
        System.out.println("Number of rows returned: " + results.size());
    }

    /**
     * Simulates a SQL query that returns no results because the condition is always false.
     * @return an empty list of TableRow objects.
     */
    public static List<TableRow> selectFromTableWhereConditionIsFalse() {
        // Since the condition 1 = 2 is always false, we return an empty list
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **TableRow Class**: This class is a placeholder for the structure of a row in the database table. You can add fields to this class that represent the columns of your table.
- **selectFromTableWhereConditionIsFalse Method**: This method simulates the SQL query by returning an empty list, as the SQL query would return no rows due to the condition `1 = 2`.
- **Main Method**: Demonstrates calling the method and printing the number of rows returned, which will always be zero.
